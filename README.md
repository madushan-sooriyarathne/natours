## Source code of first project in ["Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!" course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/ Link to the Course on Udemy) by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) 

## Project Overview 
In this project we have used Sass Css preprocessor and to compile sass(scss) files to css we used node-sass npm module
(you can install all required modules by running `npm install` command in your terminal / cmd)

PS: included one JS file to add some extra functionality to the final website(not included in original course). check js/main.js file for more info
